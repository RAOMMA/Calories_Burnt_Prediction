# Calories Burnt Prediction

This Python script predicts the number of calories burnt by an individual based on various health-related features. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: [Calories Burnt Prediction]
- **Data Source**: [upload on git]

The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Feature columns: [User_ID,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,Duration,Heart_Rate,Body_Temp]
- Target column: [Calories]

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **main.py**: Python script for making calorie burn predictions.
- **model.joblib**: Pre-trained machine learning model for calorie burn prediction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd calories-burn-prediction

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

## Usage
-Clone this repository to your local machine.

-Ensure you have the pre-trained machine learning model ('model.joblib') in the same directory as the script ('main.py').

-Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

-Run the script with the appropriate command-line arguments for gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
## For example:

`python main.py --Gender "female" --Age 25 --Height 160 --Weight 60 --Duration 30 --Heart_Rate 120 --Body_Temp 37`

Follow the instructions in the script to make predictions.

## Model Training
The project uses a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burnt. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.joblib'.

## Evaluation
The script provides predictions for calories burnt based on the input features. You can evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results
The project provides predictions for calorie burn based on the input features. The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the project:

-Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.

-Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.

-Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
